## 1.Research hypothesis

### Phase 1

1. Rice rhizosphere soil microbiome can differentiate cultivation methods (organic vs. chemical farming) and can be used for rapid organic farming validation.  
2. While locations influence rhizosphere soil microbiome, core microbiome, microbial network hubs, and key species are similar regardless of geographical locations or cultivation methods. 
3. Applying organic fertilizer to promote healthy rhizosphere soil core microbiome (fungi and bacteria) will significantly improve rice growth and productivity. 
 

## 2.Rationale

Thailand, which is one of the major rice producers in the world, is adopting organic rice farming practice to reduce chemical inputs and promote healthy soil. However, the organic farming validation process takes time. Therefore, our plan is 1) to explore the rhizosphere soil microbiome, 2) to develop a protocol for a new rapid organic farming validation using next generation amplicon sequencing, and 3) to promote core microbiome growth for the next generation organic rice farming in Thailand. 

## 3.Protocols validation

Next generation amplicon sequencing has been used widely and is now affordable in Thailand. However, soil microbiome are complexed especially when we investigate both fungi and bacteria. Therefore, developing this protocol require both experts in rice and microbiome research. Although, the initiative for this project has just been launched, Dr.P’Poy works on organic rice farming, Dr.P’George works on botany and plant sciences research, and Mr.Pombubpa works on microbiology and plant pathology research. Pombubpa et al., 2020 has shown that soil microbiome are strongly structured by geographical locations and have validated the protocols that can be adapted for hypothesis 1 and 2. 

## 4.Research plan

### Phase1
1. 5 locations of organic rice farms and 5 conventional rice farms will be selected.
2. Three soil samples will be collected from each location and used to cultivate the same rice variety in the greenhouse. 
3. Microbial DNA will be extracted from each pot and performed next gen amplicon sequencing targeting bacteria and fungi.
4. Microbial ecology approaches will be used to explore microbiome data to define geographical patterns, core microbiome, microbial network hubs, and key species.

### Phase2
1. Different organic fertilizer or organic farming practices will be used to promote core microbiome growth and investigate how rhizosphere core microbiome changes affect rice growth and rice production.
